Since the working distance is large compared to the focal length (\\(g&gt;gg f\\)), the relative error introduced by this approximation is very small, but still present.

This is because it is the same projective geometry; in essence, it is the same math, but written in two different coordinate frames. In 3.6 we compute the dimensions using lens-equations, i.e. we use a thin-lens model, whereas we in 4.1-4.3 use a pinhole camera. The thin-lens equation simply determines the image distance \\(b\\), while triangulation describes how 3D points map to the image plane once \\(b\\) is known. </p> <p>Although the thin-lens model is physically more detailed, it is rarely used in the machine vision industry because the image distance \\(b\\) cannot be recovered from images alone. This is due to the fact that \\(b\\) is fundamentally entangled with the unknown (or variable) object distance. As a result, \\(b\\) is not an observable quantity in projective imaging. </p> <p>Computer vision therefore uses a pinhole model in which all internal camera geometry is absorbed into an effective focal length measured directly in pixel units. This directly translates to saying that lens thickness and internal structure are irrelevant for projective geometry, once the image is in focus and the working distance is large. </p>"},{"location":"readme_new/#exercise-5-measuring-with-sub-pixel-precision","title":"Exercise 5: Measuring with sub-pixel precision","text":"<p>Due to the discrepancy found in exercise 3.8, the metrologists re-do the experiment, as they realize they cannot rely on thin-lens theory.
